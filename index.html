      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        BullyBlock is a web application designed to enhance the safety and educational quality of K-12 public schools
        by integrating directly with the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS). This system uses advanced Natural
        Language Processing (NLP) techniques to monitor, analyze, and alert on potential cyberbullying communications in
        real time.

      <h2>Societal Problem && Solution</h2>
      <p>
        Cyberbullying is an increasingly pervasive issue in K-12 schools, causing profound negative effects on students' 
        mental health, academic performance, and overall well-being. Recognizing the urgent need for effective solutions, 
        BullyBlock introduces an innovative, web-based cyberbullying detection system fully integrated with the 
        Canvas Learning Management System (LMS). Our platform leverages cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
        algorithms to analyze digital communications in real-time, identifying harmful language and behaviors across 
        all online interactions within the educational environment. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon detection, the system instantly alerts educators, administrators, and security personnel, enhancing their 
        intelligence on emerging issues and enabling swift intervention to support affected students. By streamlining the 
        monitoring process, BullyBlock allows teachers to focus more on teaching and less on classroom management. 
        By proactively addressing cyberbullying, BullyBlock not only enhances the safety and well-being of students in 
        online spaces but also fosters a more inclusive and supportive educational atmosphere that translates into a 
        safer physical environment, ultimately contributing to improved educational outcomes in K-12 schools.
