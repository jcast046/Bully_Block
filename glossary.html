    <li><strong>BullyBlock</strong>: The system designed to monitor and detect cyberbullying behavior within the Canvas Learning Management System.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Canvas LMS</strong>: A widely used Learning Management System (LMS) in K-12 schools, where BullyBlock integrates to monitor and detect cyberbullying.</li><br>
    <li><strong>CI/CD</strong>: Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery practices that automate the process of code integration and deployment, enabling developers to deliver updates and new features quickly and reliably.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Data Encryption</strong>: Security practice used to protect sensitive data within BullyBlock, ensuring unauthorized users cannot access the stored information.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Data Privacy Compliance (FERPA)</strong>: Refers to adherence to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, ensuring that student data is handled securely and used only within the bounds of the law.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Data Scraping</strong>: Algorithms to gather data from Canvas interactions for analysis.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Dashboard</strong>: A visual interface in BullyBlock that provides data and analytics on flagged incidents, helping educators review and manage bullying cases.</li><br>
    <li><strong>False Positives</strong>: Instances where benign interactions are incorrectly flagged as cyberbullying, potentially leading to unnecessary alerts and requiring further refinement of the detection model.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Frontend</strong>: The client-side portion of an application that users interact with directly, typically built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React, designed to enhance user experience and interface functionality.</li><br>
    <li><strong>GitHub Actions</strong>: A CI/CD tool used to automate testing and deployment processes for the development of the BullyBlock application.</li><br>
    <li><strong>IDE</strong>: Integrated Development Environment, a comprehensive software suite that provides developers with tools for writing, debugging, and managing code, including features such as code completion, syntax highlighting, and version control integration.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Keras (Python)</strong>: A high-level neural networks API that runs on top of TensorFlow, simplifying complex model building.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Languages</strong>: Programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, and Python that are utilized in the development of applications, each offering unique features and capabilities for implementing business logic and user interfaces.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong>: A subset of artificial intelligence used to improve the cyberbullying detection algorithm by analyzing historical data to refine and enhance detection accuracy.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Machine Learning Model</strong>: For predictive analysis based on historical data to improve detection accuracy over time.</li><br>
    <li><strong>MongoDB</strong>: A NoSQL database chosen for its flexibility in handling unstructured data, storing user messages, posts, incidents, and alerts generated by the system.</li><br>
    <li><strong>NLP (Natural Language Processing)</strong>: A technology used by BullyBlock to analyze text data in real-time, enabling the detection of harmful language and patterns of bullying in online communications.</li><br>
    <li><strong>NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)</strong>: A Python library for text processing and analysis, supporting tasks like tokenization and part-of-speech tagging, essential for understanding text structure in the detection of bullying behavior.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Performance Monitoring Tool</strong>: A software application or system, such as Prometheus, that continuously tracks and assesses the performance and health of applications or services, providing insights into resource usage and operational efficiency to help identify and resolve issues.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Prometheus</strong>: A monitoring tool used in the project to track performance metrics and system efficiency, helping identify and resolve potential issues as the platform scales.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Puppeteer (Node.js)</strong>: A library used for scraping dynamic content controlled by JavaScript.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Real-time Monitoring</strong>: The ability of BullyBlock to actively scan communications as they happen, allowing immediate detection and alerting for potential cyberbullying incidents.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: The systemâ€™s capability to grow and handle more users or larger datasets without performance degradation, making it adaptable to different school sizes and districts.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Scrapy (Python)</strong>: A Python framework for web scraping on a large scale.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong>: A component of NLP that evaluates the emotional tone behind a message to help identify negative or harmful interactions.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Stanford NLP</strong>: A comprehensive suite of NLP tools available in Python and Java, offering a range of linguistic processing capabilities, such as named entity recognition, which enhances the system's accuracy in identifying complex interactions.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Testing Frameworks</strong>: Tools, including Jest and Mocha, used to create and run automated tests for JavaScript applications, ensuring that code behaves as expected and maintaining software quality through systematic testing processes.</li><br>
    <li><strong>UI</strong>: User Interface, the space where user interaction with the application occurs.</li><br>
    <li><strong>UX</strong>: User Experience, the overall experience of a user when interacting with the application.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Version Control</strong>: A system, such as GitHub, that helps manage changes to source code over time, allowing multiple developers to collaborate effectively and track modifications to the codebase.</li><br>
    <li><strong>VADER (Python, within NLTK)</strong>: A sentiment analysis tool specialized for analyzing sentiments in social media text, useful in assessing the emotional context of Canvas interactions.</li><br>
